### Project:
A website that helps with meal planning and provides nutrition information.


### Technologies

* Python
* Django

### 1st Prototype Description:
A simple webpage that can access the USDA nutrition facts database through two buttons: "Egg" and "Broccoli". The buttons will be basic buttons with text on them. Clicking on either button will retrieve the information (serving size, calories, total fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carb, protein) of that food and display it on the screen in a table. The user can click a back button to return to the previous page to select a food again if they so wish.
